## Question 8
##### Hypotheses
*i*. $ A \rightarrow (B \wedge C)$

*ii*. $ (B \vee D) \rightarrow E $

*iii*. $ A \vee D $

*iv*. $ \rightharpoondown(B \wedge C) $

Imply the conclusion: $ E $ 

### Proof
| proposition | reason |
|:----- |:----  |
|  $ \rightharpoondown(B \wedge C) $       |   *iv*  |
|  $ \rightharpoondown A $       |   by Modus Tollens, *i* and *iv*  |
|  $ A \vee D $       |   *iii*  |
|  $ D $       |   by Disjunctive Syllogism  |
|  $ B \vee D $       |   by Addition |
|  $ (B \vee D) \rightarrow E $       |   *ii* |
|  $ E $       |   by Modus Ponens and *ii* |

## Question 9

| #  | English | Symbolic |
|:-- | :----   | :--------|
| a. | Lois has asked Professor Michaels a question.  | $ A(\mathsf{Lois},\mathsf{Professor Michaels}) $ |
| b. | Every student has asked Professor Gross a question.  | $ \forall{x}[S(x) \rightarrow A(x,\mathsf{Professor Gross})] $ |
| c. | Some student has not asked any faculty member a question.   | $ \exists{x}[S(x) \wedge \forall{y}(F(y) \rightarrow ¬A(x,y))] $ |
| d. | There is a faculty member who has never been asked a question by a student. | $ \exists{x}[F(x) \wedge \forall{y}(S(y) \rightarrow ¬A(y,x))] $ |
| e. | Some student has asked every faculty member a question. | $ \forall{y}[F(y) \rightarrow \exists{x}(S(x) \wedge A(x,y)] $  |
| f. | Some student has never been asked a question by a faculty member. | $ \exists{x}[S(x) \wedge \forall{y}(F(y) \wedge ¬A(y,x))] $ |


## Question 10
| # | Question | Answer | Reason |
| :------: | -------- | :-----: | ------ |
| a | $ \forall{x}\exists{y}(x^2 = y)$ | T | any number $\mathbb{R}$ can be squared to produce another number in $\mathbb{R}$ |
| b | $ \forall{x}\exists{y}(x = y^2)$ | F | because when $ x = -4 $ there is no $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ |
| c | $ \exists{x}\forall{y}(xy = 0)$ | T | because when $ x = 0 $ all $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ yield a $ 0 $ product. |
| d | $ \forall{x}(x \neq 0 \rightarrow \exists{y}(xy = 1)) $ | T | when $y$ is the reciprocal of $x$ (i.e. $ x = 10$ and $y = \frac{1}{10}$). |
| e | $ \exists{x}\forall{y}(y \neq 0 \rightarrow xy = 1)$ | T | when $x$ is the reciprocal of $y$ (i.e. $ y = 10$ and $x = \frac{1}{10}$). |
| f | $ \exists{x}\exists{y}(x + 2y = 2 \wedge 2x + 4y = 5) $ | F | when rewritten as linear equations $ y = 1 - \frac{1}{2}x$ and $y = \frac{5}{4} - \frac{1}{2}x$ they represent two parallel lines that never intersect and therefore have no common solution for $x$ and $y$ |
| g | $\forall{x}\exists{y}(x + y = 2 \wedge 2x - y = 1) $ | F | when rewritten as linear equations $y = 2 - x$ and $y = 2x - 1$ they would need to have the same slope and $y$-intercept to be true (i.e. be the same line) |
